		<h3>Information:</h3>
		<p>
			The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a species of requiem shark and the only extant member of the genus Galeocerdo. It is a large macropredator, capable of attaining a length over 5 m (16 ft 5 in).Populations are found in many tropical and temperate waters, especially around central Pacific islands. Its    name derives from the dark stripes down its body, which resemble a tiger's pattern, but fade as the shark matures.
			The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, with a range of prey that includes crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea snakes, dolphins, and even other smaller sharks. It also has a reputation as a "garbage eater", consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach. Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken as prey by groups of killer whales. It is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing by humans.
			The tiger shark is second only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans.
